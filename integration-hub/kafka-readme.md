# Kafka Architect's Deep Dive Study Guide

## 1. Core Concepts: Beyond the Basics

**Producer:** Applications that publish data.  
**Key Insight:** Producers are responsible for partitioning strategy (key vs. round-robin) and can trade off between latency, throughput, and durability via batching and acknowledgments.

**Consumer:** Applications that read data.  
**Key Insight:** Consumers work as part of a **Consumer Group**, which is the logical unit of parallelism. The **consumer offset** is a core concept, representing their position in the log.

**Topic:** A category/feed name. A logical entity that is physically manifested as a set of partitions distributed across brokers.
- A logical category or feed name where messages are published (e.g., user-signup).
- A single topic can have multiple partitions.
- Partitions provide scalability, allow multiple consumers to process messages in parallel, and maintain ordering within each partition.

**Example A single topic can have multiple partitions**

**Topic:** `user-signup` → 3 partitions:

| Partition | Messages       |
|-----------|----------------|
| 0         | m1, m4, m7    |
| 1         | m2, m5, m8    |
| 2         | m3, m6, m9    |


**Key Points:**
- Producers write signup events to the user-signup topic.
- Consumers read from user-signup partitions.
- Partitions allow parallel processing, while replication ensures durability.
  
*So yes, **user-signup** is the topic name, just like order-created, payment-processed, or page-views could be topic names.*


**Broker:** An individual server within a Kafka cluster that stores data, facilitates replication, and serves client requests. Brokers work together to form a scalable and fault-tolerant distributed system.

**Cluster:** The central nervous system. Comprised of multiple brokers, coordinated using **KRaft (Kafka Raft metadata mode)** for metadata management.

**Example: Post Office Distribution Center**

Imagine a massive, highly organized **Post Office Distribution Center**:

| Kafka        | Postal Service Analogy                                                                 |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Producer**        | People and businesses dropping off packages and letters                                |
| **Broker**          | The entire distribution center building and its internal systems                       |
| **Topic**           | Different mail categories (e.g., "Standard Mail," "Express Packages," "International") |
| **Partition**       | Specific sorting lines within each category (e.g., "International Line A," "International Line B") |
| **Consumer**        | Mail trucks waiting to load sorted packages for final delivery                         |
| **Cluster**         | Server,Network of multiple distribution centers working together                              |
| **Replication**     | Making photocopies of important documents before sorting them to different lines       |

## 2. Partitions & Replication: The Heart of Scalability & Durability

**Partition:** A topic is split into partitions. This is the unit of parallelism.  
- A physical log inside a topic. Each partition is ordered, immutable, and stored on a broker.
- Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records (a commit log).  
- Records are assigned a unique, sequential ID called an **offset**.
- Kafka stores partition data on disk as **log segments**.

**Each log segment consists of three main files**
- log file: contains the actual messages.
- index file: provides quick lookup of messages by offset.
- timeindex file: allows lookup of messages by timestamp.
- Default segment size = 1 GB (configurable with log.segment.bytes)
- When a segment reaches the max size (e.g., 1 GB), Kafka closes it and starts a new one.

  
**Key Concept:** Order is guaranteed only within a partition, not across partitions.

**Replication Factor:** The number of copies of each partition. Production standard is 3.

**Leader Replica:** Handles all read and write requests for a partition.  
**Follower Replica:** Brokers with a copy of the partition, asynchronously replicating data from the leader.

**In-Sync Replicas (ISR):** The set of replicas (leader + followers) that are currently alive and caught-up.

**How Long Data is Stored (Retention)**
Kafka keeps data independent of whether consumers read it or not.
Two main policies control this:

1. Time-based retention (log.retention.hours, default = 168 hours / 7 days).\
Example: keep messages for 7 days, then delete old ones.
2. Size-based retention (log.retention.bytes).\
Example: keep up to 10 GB per partition, then remove the oldest segments.

*Whichever limit is reached first (time OR size), old data is deleted.*

## 3. Deep Dive: Producer Mechanics

**Batching:** Accumulate messages in memory and send in larger batches.  
- Controlled by `linger.ms` (how long to wait for more messages) and `batch.size`.

**Acknowledgment (`acks`):** Trade-off between durability and latency.  
- `acks=0`: Fire-and-forget, highest throughput, no guarantee.  
- `acks=1` (default): Leader writes to its log and acknowledges. Balance of durability & latency.  
- `acks=all` or `acks=-1`: Leader waits for all ISR replicas. Strongest durability. Requires `min.insync.replicas`.

**Idempotent Producer:** Prevents message duplicates caused by retries.  
- Enable via `enable.idempotence=true`.

**Compression:** (`compression.type=lz4|snappy|gzip`) applied on producer side. Saves network bandwidth & broker storage.

## 4. Deep Dive: Consumer Mechanics & Groups

**Consumer Group:** A set of consumers cooperating to consume data from one or more topics.  

**Golden Rule:** Each partition is consumed by exactly **one consumer** in the group.  

**Rebalancing:** Partition assignment process; a stop-the-world event where all consumers pause.

**Delivery Semantics:**
- **At-most-once:** Commit offset immediately. Risk: message loss if processing fails.  
- **At-least-once (most common):** Commit after processing. Risk: duplicate processing if crash occurs before commit.  
- **Exactly-once:** Achieved via Kafka Transactions API or atomic offset + processing commit.

---

## 5. Advanced Architecture & Durability

**min.insync.replicas:** Critical for `acks=all`.  
- Example: `replication.factor=3` and `min.insync.replicas=2`. Tolerates failure of one broker without losing writes.

**Unclean Leader Election (`unclean.leader.election.enable`):**  
- `false` (recommended): Only ISR replicas can become leader → prevents data loss.  
- `true`: Out-of-sync replicas can become leader → improves availability, risks data loss. Never enable for critical data.

---

## 6. Ecosystem & Stream Processing

**Kafka Connect:** Build reliable, scalable pipelines between Kafka & other systems.  
- **Source Connectors:** Ingest data into Kafka (e.g., CDC from PostgreSQL with Debezium).  
- **Sink Connectors:** Export data from Kafka (e.g., Elasticsearch, S3, data warehouse).

**Kafka Streams & ksqlDB:** Libraries for stream processing.  
- **KStream:** Infinite stream of events.  
- **KTable:** Evolving state of a changelog stream (latest snapshot).

---

## 7. The Future: KRaft (KIP-500)

**Problem:** Kafka's dependency on external metadata storage (previously ZooKeeper) added operational complexity and bottleneck.  

**Solution:** KRaft (Kafka Raft metadata mode) uses Raft protocol for metadata management within brokers.  

**Benefits:**
- Simpler architecture: No external metadata service needed.  
- Improved performance: Faster controller failover & leader election.  
- Massive scalability: Millions of partitions supported.

---

## 8. Example Setup

**Topic:** `user-signup` | **Partitions:** 3 | **Replication Factor:** 3 | **min.insync.replicas:** 2

- Tolerates **1 broker failure** without data loss/write unavailability.  
- If a **second broker fails**, writes are rejected (ISR < `min.insync.replicas`), but reads still work.

| Partition | Leader   | Follower (ISR) | Follower (ISR) |
|-----------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| 0         | Broker-1| Broker-2       | Broker-3       |
| 1         | Broker-2| Broker-3       | Broker-1       |
| 2         | Broker-3| Broker-1       | Broker-2       |

> Distribution ensures no single broker is leader for all partitions, spreading load evenly.

## Message (Record) Structure
Each Kafka message (also called a record) has:
- Key → Optional. Used for partitioning and ensuring ordering if present.
- Value → Required. The actual payload (e.g., JSON, Avro, string, binary).
- Timestamp → Event time (set by producer) or log append time (set by broker). Optional if producer doesn’t provide.
- Headers → Optional metadata as key-value pairs.
- Offset → Unique sequential ID assigned by the broker for each partition.

## Producer (Message Publisher)

1. Publishes messages to topics
- The producer is the application or service that creates messages and sends them to Kafka.  
- Messages are sent to a **topic**, which is a logical category or feed name in Kafka.  
**Examples:** `user-signup`, `order-events`.

2. Chooses the partition using
- Kafka topics are split into **partitions** for scalability and parallelism.  
- The producer decides which partition a message goes to using different strategies:

- **Key hash:** If a message has a key, Kafka uses its hash to determine the partition. This ensures that messages with the same key always go to the same partition, preserving **order**.
- **Round-robin:** If no key is provided, Kafka distributes messages evenly across partitions in a round-robin manner.
- **Custom partitioner:** You can define your own logic to choose partitions based on your business requirements.

3. Uses batching, compression, and acknowledgments for performance
- **Batching:** Producer can send multiple messages together in a batch to reduce network overhead.
- **Compression:** Messages can be compressed to save bandwidth and storage.
- **Acknowledgments (acks):**
  - `acks=0`: Fire-and-forget, fastest but no guarantee.
  - `acks=1`: Wait for leader acknowledgment.
  - `acks=all`: Wait for all replicas, ensures maximum durability.

4. Sends required Value, and optionally Key, Timestamp, and Headers
- **Value:** This is the main content of the message. It is **mandatory**.
- **Key:** Optional, used for partitioning and ordering.
- **Timestamp:** Optional; can represent event time (set by producer) or log append time (set by broker).
- **Headers:** Optional metadata for extra context like correlation IDs, tracing info, or custom tags.
